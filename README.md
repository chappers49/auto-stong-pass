# auto-stong-pass
Automation of creating  strong passwords
We are creating a basic Flask web application that allows users to input a password and recieve feedback on its strenght. 
Flask is a lightweight Python web framework that's easy to set up and ideal for small projects like this. 

Requirements:
-Pythong installed on your server
-Flask installed (pip install flask) 

This setup automates the process of checking password strength by making it accessible as a web service, 
which users can interact with through a web interface.
